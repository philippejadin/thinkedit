Thinkedit CMS - Archive Only

This was my third attempt at CMS'es in the early 2000's. There were interesting ideas imho, like having node content types and config as text file for each content type. This is roughly what Drupal became at the same time I worked in my basement. I discovered Drupal and stopped custom dev.

This is only for historical purposes (and will likely only touch me :-) )
