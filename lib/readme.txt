Here we store any third party tool. The tool is not part of thinkedit nor written by any author of thinkedit.

Currently it's not totally true : we have a thinkedit lib, that must be replaced by classes, or it's own procedural function folder

Each third party tool has it's own folder of course.

Please check (todo) licence before comiting. We need GPL or LGPL (like) code I guess. It is currently the case, so only add fully open souce library here.
