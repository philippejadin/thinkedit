07-03-2006 : big performance problems with bigger trees (more than 100's nodes)



Optimization ideas : 

1.
- store the node level in the DB + update method
- store the hasChildren results
- store the hierarchy (like cmsmadesimple)

do all the functions based on a single sql query, with filtering
update sort order functions to use ints, and update when needed
pad order to 00001.00002.00001 for instance.

2.
Store the level and order as if it was a flat list :

order  name        level
1      Home        0
2        Products  1
3        News      1
4        Press     1

etc...


3. use a separate table for
