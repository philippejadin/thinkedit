Configuration keywords


<use></use>

can be put in table, field, others (?)


- main
- list
- edit
- relation
- structure


<field>
<use>list,edit</use>
</field>
means this field will be shown in list, edit  mode

<table>
<use>main</use>
</table>
Means this table will be shown on the homepage


Other config format
-------------------

1. YAML
I tried yaml, but it doesn't work well (no tabs, weak indent system)


2. currently : XML
The only problem with xml is to have a two directions conversion

like xml<->array

We currently only have xml -> array


We could also use php arrays and php include :

$config['table']['page']['title']['en'] = 'Page'

Pro : 
- ultra fast (php include, no cache needed)
- simple to read write files
- exact representation of php data structure

Con :
- not so good for human editing
- redundant (if you want to rename a table, you have to mod every ['table_name'] item)
- how to serialize $table[0],[1], [2] etc... ?


3. Json ?
