Custom tags in postings to link to nodes or images or wathever is needed

It could use a wiki syntax or bbcode (which is almost the same)


Use case : use wants to link to another node inside content.

Wiki : 
[node:5] -> index.php?node_id=5&etc...

BBcode :
[node=5]Mylink to node 5[/node]

or BBcode variant :
[node id=5]Mylink to node 5[/node]
