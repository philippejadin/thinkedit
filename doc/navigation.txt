New menu system (proposal)

te_menu($root, $depth)

if root is a root node and depth = 1, it will return a main menu

if root is the current node and level = 3, it will return a 3 level contextual menu.

How navigation in templates works


There are different classes for navigation. They are all of this pattern :

menu.xxx.class.php where xxx is the menu type

for example main menu (top level) is menu.main.class.php


Each menu class has at least those methods : 

- render() -> renders the menu as html, for simple use cases

- getArray()->gives an array of menu items :
  A menu item has those methods :
	
	- getTitle()
	- getUrl()
	- getLevel()
	- isCurrent();
	
	etc...

	
You can use either render() to render the menu for you or getArray() to generate the html yourself


In templates, on content objects, you can use :

$content->isUsedIn($something);

$something can be, for instance 'navigation'

This means : do I need to display this content in my navigation.


This can be set in configuration using : 

['table']['page']['use']['navigation'] = 'true'
